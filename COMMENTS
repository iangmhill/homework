Hi Ad Hoc Engineers,

I'm excited to be applying for the role of Full Stack Developer. In this repo,
I've completed the hhbuilder and the fetch assignments. You shouldn't have to do
anything special to run my code.

Thank you!

Hi Ad Hoc Engineers,

Per your request for an additional submission. I've completed the slcsp
assignment. I used Python 3 to determine the SLCSP rates, so assuming you have that installed, you can just run ```python determine_slcsp.py```.

Thanks again!
